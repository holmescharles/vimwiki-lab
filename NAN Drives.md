## Noise

Jul 10

Suhwan noticed intermittent noise with the NAN and OE.

- I played with the shielding and determined 2 things.
  1. Grounding the CMS table was sufficient to remove motor noise.
  2. Pitching the guide tube clamp caused discharge noise.

The T shaped piece connecting the guide tube to the CMS table was not grounded was made of metal.
It should avoid conducting to the tower because there is a silicone sleeve in the shaft of the tower.
However, pitching it may be enough to connect the metal T and the tower.
I verified the intermittent connection with an ohmmeter.

I replaced the metal T with plastic ones from Ben's old supplies.
This seems to have fixed it.
Still need to verify in the monk.
