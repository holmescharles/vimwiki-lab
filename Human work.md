# Human Work

## To Do (someday)

- BHV2 Parser!

- Make eye tracking double-ended
- Set up the block structure for the userloop
- Decide where to keep data (Google Drive)?
- Fix the "skipped frames" issue.
- Build a wiki (maybe start here)
- Parameterize and/or clean up touch feedback
- Modularize the monkeylogic code?
- Handle touches when both home buttons are engaged (should be an error)
- Decide which factors need to be editable.
  - Make targets bigger or smaller (smaller = harder)
