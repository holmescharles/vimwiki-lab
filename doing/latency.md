- Look at new data (from ephys experiments).
- Do they have quick-reach/slow-saccade trials?
- Consider instructed vs Free.

I plotted RT data for the two recent ephys behavior sessions.
I found that the slow saccades were absent, though this may be because there were no extremely lateral reaches in these data.

TODO
- [ ] Email Larry about saccade detection.
