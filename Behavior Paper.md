## Behavior paper

We have data from JRR.
Next, we need data from Kili.

## To Do

  - [ ] Train Kili to reliably free reach (no delay; about 2 days)

  - [ ] Collect standard data (about 4 days)

  - [ ] Collect button shift data (1 week)
  - [ ] Collect head yaw data (1 week)
  - [ ] Collect gaze shift data (1 week)

### Potential Issues

- JRR needed to be "eased into" button shifts, so Kili may need a few days of gradually increasing the eccentricity.
