- Needs hemispheres

I've determined I sent him old data.
The new data are tar balled and I probably sent them directory to Sergei.
I think the simplest solution will be to:

1. [x] Write a README that explains the data.
2. [x] Export (at least) the README and the mat-files to google drive.
3. [x] Share folder with Ian.

I've sent the data via google drive and notified Ian and Eric via Discord.
